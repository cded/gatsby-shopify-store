                At HB LEDCO, we are passionate about home decor and lighting. We
                have been thinking for a long time about how we could combine
                both to create a cutting edge and modern atmosphere in our
                homes. Thatâ€™s when we had the idea to integrate RGB LED lights
                directly in furniture. We spent a few months on the drawing
                boards, visualizing and sketching multiple designs. We are now
                finally able to proudly present our catalog.

                Bright! Our pieces are more than just furniture; they are works
